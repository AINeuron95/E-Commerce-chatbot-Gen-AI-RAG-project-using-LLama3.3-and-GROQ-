# E-Commerce-chatbot-Gen-AI-RAG-project-using-LLama3.3-and-GROQ-
This project is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for an intelligent e-commerce chatbot that enables natural, accurate, and real-time user interactions.
The chatbot identifies user intent using semantic routing and responds by either retrieving information from a vector database or executing LLM-generated SQL queries on a live database.

The system is designed using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture and can be extended to production-scale e-commerce platforms.
